# Sign-up-Form

A dummy sign-up form to put into practice new html + css that I have learnt.

Plan:

Two sections, with the left side containing the Odin logo ontop of a background image, and the right side containing all the information.

Right section should have a header and a main, and maybe a footer(?)

Header should contain the top text in two separate p elements.

Main should DEFINITELY contain a header, "Let's do this!", and a form containing inputs for First name, Last name, Email, Phone Number, Password and confirm password in that order.

Main _might_ contain the create account button and the "Already have an account? Log in." text, alternatively, this could be included in a footer.

Left section should have a div containing the Odin logo and text, in img and h(something) elements respectively. It should also contain a footer crediting the photo. The background for left section should be an unsplashed image.
